## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application will build a city explorer server response to client queries based on selected city. It will return set data about the city the user wants to explore.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Create a server side environment by configuring machine to use express, cors, and dotenv, and create files and folders to adhere to the file tree provided. dotenv is require to run on machine.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Currently using javascript, express js, jquery, and .json files for data storage.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
